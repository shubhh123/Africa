1. Started off with Main View. Added Tab View [Just like you have in a normal application to navigate to different sections in your app]
    ContentView acts as a serves as the entry point and root view of your SwiftUI application.
    
    The .tabItem modifier is applied to provide an icon (in this case, a square grid icon) for the tab, which will be displayed in the tab bar.
    
2. Added all the necessary Views to the Tab view

3. Replaced the ContentView() with MainView() in AfricaApp...



4. Created a Model: CoverImageModel
        Conforming to Codable means that instances of your type can be encoded to a JSON or other data format and decoded back from that format.
